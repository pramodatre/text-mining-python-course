4.5,"So far, so good!"
5.0,Very nice introduction to advanced text machine techniques. I wanted to get a snapshot of various methods available and deduce what is the right method for my text mining problem at hand and I clearly go it from the course.
1.0,"not good,total waste of money and time..not giving where to write and how to write code...."
5.0,I was not satisfied abut the quality of instruction. The instructor seemed to rush through all the topics. This is an advanced course and 2.5 hours of video is far from being sufficient to cover all topics in detail. In order to cover all the topics clearly and not rushing through the details this needs to be at least 25 hours of video. I am saying so because other course on NLP on Udemy are all reasonably long and convey the concept slowly and clearly without rush.
3.5,"I would name this course as ""A High-level Summary of Machine Learning for Text"". I was already familiar with most of what he presented and was interested in getting more in-depth explanations. For example: how to train my own NER model using spaCy? The author does cover it, but in a too fast way and with very shallow explanations. Sometimes he goes through a big portion of code explaining with a 3-word comment and you are left clueless about how to apply that to other use-cases you may need."
5.0,I came to know more in detail about text classification. The explanation is simple and easy to understand.  Thank you so much for teaching in detail. I really recommend this course for beginners who wants to learn more about text mining.
4.5,"A real inspiration. Very interesting topics, well presented."
3.5,"This course was good for gaining an overall idea in NLP. It has quite a few walk-through examples. However, hands-on learning is limited."
4.5,Es ist alles sehr gut erklärt - ich hätte mir mehr Übungen gewünscht um es direkt anwenden zu können.
2.0,"hard one. the course topics looked very promising, but the content itself is underwhelming. If you want to get a current status overview of what text analysis can do this is probably a great course, if you want to learn more because you have some experience already you won't find what you need. "
2.0,Teorik olarak anlatım yapılıyor. Örnek sayısı yetersiz.
3.0,Too little explanation of runtime. Course not very comprehensive
3.5,I'd love to have more real examples ( code and use case )
5.0,В курсе есть вся информация об алгоритмах работы с текстами.
3.0,I think it is good.
5.0,Good Overview
3.5,Very nice
4.5,"The instructor, so far, has provided a clear and comprehensive introduction to the topic."
2.0,Recordings are too old (5+ years). Videos are just going over a script and reading the Help section of packages.
4.0,The course has been useful.  One problem is that it was recorded some time in the past and newer versions of functions act differently so I had to find a few ways around problems using Google search but that is good practice too.
5.0,"actually , I wouldn't be exaggerating if i said that this is the best course I've taken so far. "
5.0,"This is a highly focused and well-designed class around Twitter and Sentiment analysis.  The construction of the Breen sentiment scoring function is a nice takeaway.  If you have never done Twitter or analysis of words, this is a good course in R to start with and build from."
1.0,"Twitter is now on TLS1.2.. the handshake code does not work and returns errorrror in function (type, msg, asError = TRUE)  : "
1.5,Please answer the questions!
4.0,This was pretty good.  I knew very little about the scraping of Tweets so I found this valuable.  I already knew a lot about Text Mining.  I was very interested in sentiment analysis. The instructor's presentation of it was good but I would have liked to have learned other methods of sentiment analysis such as the ones in the qdap and syuzhet packages.
4.0,The tutorials and mini projects are truly great - Best way to learn. The tutor did a good job in structuring and organizing this course. Great way to learn.
4.5,"I found this course very educative opened up new ideas to me. However, I didn't like the placement of the course scripts which will to help you follow the video."
4.0,The content is comprehensive but some times a little basic. I expected far too much from an advanced R course. The course gives an interesting toolbox to deal with unstructured data which is very productive because is uncommon to analyze this kind of data. The quality of the course is good but could be improved in the written material.
3.0,"It was overall OK, but 1) narration speed was too slow, 2) some of the actions shown couldn't be replicated without googling the problem and adding something that wasn't shown, 3) the coverage is rather limited, as there are many other tasks one might need to do, like extracting user information, separating tweets from retweets, comparing geographic distribution of sentiment, etc., etc."
4.0,"This course provides a nice introduction to text mining and sentiment analysis in R. Although the course is rated as advance, I found it pretty easy and straightforward. It is not very time consuming either. The course is good and informative though and you'll get familiar with twitter data. It would be a nice addition to work with Facebook and LinkedIn data too."
4.5,Really well done. The concepts are very easy to understand and to replicate. It is good starting point for data mining with R.
5.0,"Martin does a great job of teaching by example.  While R is not the most complicated language out here, it has plenty of packages that are built for it.  Martin has taken the topic of text mining, scraping, and sentiment analysis and shown how to accomplish these tasks through use of R.  This is a growing area of study and this course will definitely show you what can be done.  If you have any interest in this topic, the course will whet your appetite for more!"
5.0,"Great insights even for a beginner, learned a lot, crisp and clear, thanks a lot"
4.0,Teaches you the basic elements of NLP and sentiment analysis. I'd recommend this to a beginner of NLP with an intermediate level of R.
1.5,"I was expecting something more developed. I presume that the author does not have statistical background, but even though, conclusions such as ""perfectly fine prove that there is a strong correlation..."" sigh. A waste of money."
5.0,"Great course, I really like the professor's deliberate, thorough teaching style, and the fact that he provides the R code for all the cool things he teaches you about web scraping, text analytics, and sentiment analysis.   Plus he kinda sounds like Ahhnold Schwartzenegger, so that alone makes me want to listen all day."
1.0,He seem not to understand the inside of the code.
5.0,I took this course to help me on the the Capstone project from the Coursera Data Science Specialisation and I am very happy with this course contents and delivery. Thank Martin
5.0,"Useful concepts, good examples, clear explanations - Thanks!"
3.0,"I give it 3 stars because although useful, the course more or less repackages information available in CRAN depositories. I think more than anything it saves you time in learning how to implement a narrow method to scrape and perform elementary analysis on twitter data."
5.0,I am not able to create app on twitter so stuck even before started the course. I am very disappointed with missing information in course
5.0,The examples are clear.   The content is delivered concisely.  This course is worth it for the score sentiment function alone! Highly recommended!
4.5,Excellent Course for getting familiar with Social Media Analysis! Thanks Martin!
4.5,It is practical course. I learned a lot from this course. I got to know how to do  text mining and sentiment analysis with R from this course.
0.5,All the information were provided during the introduction - no more info in the following lessons. 
5.0,I really enjoyed this one especially among the previous courses. It is very practical and real life problem solving. I would appreciate to have some more real life problem and case solving tutorials.
4.5,"The content could be better, and the cleaning process could be introduced more clearly and detailed."
2.0,Because it looks very trivial to me and I think everyone by browsing the internet can find this info.
4.0,This course is very well thought out. I was not confused at any step and the instructions are very clear. I took another course similar to this one and it was not great at all. This course is worth taking!
4.5,"it would be good to know the other application of text mining, not necessarily on twitter or other social platform"
3.0,"A decent and quick introduction to text mining in R using Twitter data. The instructor does a very good job of outlining 2 different approaches to connecting to Twitter's developer API.  Unfortunately the one area the course falls flat in is how to deal with the inevitable issues with unknown characters, etc. that you will have to deal with when pulling in tweets.  If you are unable to deal with these characters, you really can't continue with the exercises in the course as all further formulas will throw errors and not run properly.  I really wish the instructor spent more time discussing how to properly clean text data since it is such an important part of the job."
4.5,"Excellent,Clear and Precise!!! But code Section for Scraping and Text Mining should have been provided."
4.0,"The course is easy to follow and worth taking. My only suggestion would be for the instructor to add more on to the sentiment analysis portion. The sentiment analysis we perform doesn't seem as useful as it could be. But I think this course is more of an intro, and it is great for that."
4.0,"The processes and functions are great! Some of the code gives errors, and I have to search online for solutions."
2.0,"Most of the course deals with accessing libraries in R, which a google search could do. This course discusses very little of the theory behind scraping."
5.0,"the course is very well structured, the teacher answer quickly your questions and he try to learn for yourself. I've been very happy with what I have learned."
0.5,"The sound is very bad,"
5.0,I liked the topic covered and some real world scenario used during the course. Also my queries were very promptly answered. Overall very good course
4.0,Good course to kick start text mining and twitter sentiment analysis!
5.0,"Very detailed explanation with examples and R code. I loved the content, explanation, pace of the course."
5.0,Great course. Really enjoyed taking this and through your courses my R knowledge is the best in my company.
4.5,I really enjoy it. Very hands on and what I learned I could immediately transfer to my daily job.
5.0,I really loved the course.. Would love to attend a course on the same using Facebook data
3.5,"Good introduction in general, allows us to know the most common packages and methods  but many steps in the coding stage are hard to replicate."
1.0,I have been following all the codes but they don´t work in the same way that the screen shows.
4.5,Very good introduction to text mining and sentiment analysis!
4.0,"I am still very new to R, so I do not understand everything that is taught completely.  But I am able to follow along and get results.  I have encountered some errors that were not addressed in the course, but so far I have been able to figure things out either via the Q&A or by looking around the internet for a few minutes."
4.0,"It was a reasonable course, teach consistently. Could have more examples and provide the source code of the classes."
5.0,very well structured ...great work Martin
4.0,Very well explained in a very understandable English. But needs to be updated.
5.0,Covers a lot of material on Text Mining and I may be able to use some of it at work.
3.0,Can't get enough data out of twitter anymore to be interesting
2.5,"Los videos tutoriales y los ejercicios a resolver son lo mismo cambiano únicamente el término de búsqueda, la idea de los ejercicios es practirar y llevar más allá lo ya expuesto en el curso, no re hacer lo que se vio en los videos anteriores"
5.0,I wish there is a follow-up class that covers mining Yelp and Amazon reviews + examples working with big data.
4.0,"Course is great, just could have been descriptive for sentiment analysis."
5.0,Excellent course for newcomers for sentiment analysis.
4.5,Thanks ! Was helpful when needed ! I didn't find it more engaging as the codes are already writing on the console.
5.0,This is my 2nd Udemy course and am very impressed with the author.  The course material is good. It serves as a good introduction to the packages for Text Mining and Sentiment analysis in R. I would recommend this course to other R programmers who are looking to get exposed to the packages in short amount of time.
4.0,"Good introduction of concepts with sample syntax, but dated."
5.0,I think this course is well designed. Most of resource of web scraping is useful
5.0,I am by no means a new user to R yet I have learnt so much already!!!!!!
5.0,Simple and effective course delivery! Loved it :)
5.0,"Great course, well worth the time."
5.0,excelente curso explicado de manera clara
5.0,"Very good course, good pace and well explained. Well worth the money"
3.0,"Good course to learn sentiment analysis - However, more details and advanced topics would have been helpful."
5.0,"Esta haciendo una introducción a las herramientas que se usaran en el curso, es decir, nos contextualiza al respecto de la generalidad. Aspiro a que cuando entre a lo particular sea igual de exhaustivo."
1.5,"VERY STOPPED, the teacher has all ready and just talks"
4.0,Very clear explanations
5.0,Martin and R-tutorials is the best way to learn R. He has incredibly deep insight with R and statistics.
4.5,it was a great experience and really its a fun...
3.5,Expecting a lot more topics in text mining and sentimental analysis
4.0,basic explanation is good
5.0,excellent experience
2.0,Voice is really specific
3.5,"Till Now, its fine and good.. Expecting more indepth coding to analyse the data"
3.5,Excellent course for begginers
5.0,I liked the topics covered in the tutorial. I even got a few ideas how to use those topics in my blog.
5.0,"congratulations, very good."
5.0,"Looks good, but looking for some real challenge now."
4.5,Very hands-on examples.
4.5,"Contents are well introduced.  I miss more detail in certain bits concerning the registration. So far, good."
3.5,So far the instructor was able to share quite clearly and laid the groundwork for more works ahead.
5.0,Awesome
1.0,"I do not understand the purpose of going through the pdfs. That is silly, waste of time."
2.0,The lecturer should provide package information more simply and make the explanation more simple or more understandable. 50% or 60% of the explanation is redundant.
0.5,"The material is outdated (2 years old) which means that some of the functions are not even available no more. Also, R has been offering for a few years now an excellent way to present code in RMarkdow, what's the purpose of using slides for which I cannot even see the output of the code that is run? That would probably help especially in those cases where the code is outdated and doesn't run."
4.0,Good detailed explanation
3.5,very short section
5.0,it gave me new things already
1.0,Hat leider schon bei der Authentifizierung gescheitert
4.5,very good
5.0,"This is easily applicable in marketing (my position). It is a quick and dirty method to see the opinions on Twitter regarding a product, company, person, etc. worth the time"
3.0,Interesting
5.0,This teacher is amazing! The material recommended is totally incredible.
0.5,"Really bad. Bad structure, bad content. Not easy to learn."
1.0,Nothing practical so far.
5.0,"A nice way to analyze Twitter. Everyone can understand this approach, simple lexicon."
5.0,superb lecturer.
4.5,Fine so far
3.0,Not sure if this course is going to be up to date at this point
5.0,Hands-on advice
2.5,Nothing constructive yet.
3.5,Haven't gotten far enough to give it a higher rating.
5.0,I love this course! very useful
5.0,Yes
5.0,Good start
3.0,Dont know yet
5.0,So far so good
5.0,Excellent!
5.0,"I was totally new to text mining, and this one was easy enought for a beginner to follow along and to understand the concepts."
4.5,"interesting content, easy to follow"
4.5,Best course
5.0,good
2.0,I was a expecting a more hands-on approach with tests and quizzes to learn alongside the course....now I need to redo the entire thing multiple times to get some kind of mastery over the topic.
4.0,"I rated this course a 4 because the content delivered was true to the objectives communicated.  I enjoyed the entire process of learning how to use Twitter to harvest tweets, then using R to process those tweets, and finally using Tableau for visualizing the data."
5.0,"This is a great course and well prepared. The instructor is making it easy to learn the R code. The best part is the integration. This  course is like a capstone project. It shows one how to do a project from scarping data and clean data, analyze data and visualize data.  I am happy that I chose this course , put time and efforts on this course.  Many thanks for the instructor. Wonderful job."
4.0,"Great course, very helpful. However, the instructor moves very quickly at times. I had to pause-unpause often and even watch this at 0.5 speed several times. He does things without narrating sometimes and the mouse moves so quickly it's a bit tricky. Other than that, highly recommend!"
4.0,"Very good practical example used, only would have loved to have more insight into sentiment analysis in r using other techniques not just the lexicon method."
5.0,"Great course on how to setup text mining using RStudio, data curation/cleaning, sentiment analysis and how to visualize this data using a Tableau dashboard.  Highly recommended!"
5.0,This is a very useful course that is a good introduction to text analysis and the manipulation of r tools
4.5,Curriculum is well laid out and articulated for learning how to extract and munge tweets; structure rules for opinion mining; and visualize the sentiment analysis.
3.5,"Overall this is very good. I feel there are some small gaps - though they could be inside me - it is never easy to separate one's own deficiencies from the instructor's content. If I don't have a means to extract a .rar file for the lexicon, it's my fault, I suppose. But it's a crucial step that would trip up some basis users. 7-zip got me through it. Overall I like it and the instructor, and that was just one example."
5.0,Marten has created another great and very practical course. He has struck a  balance between  demonstrating complexities in R and moving the analysis to Tableau to illustrate  insightful aspects of the data collected from twitter. The approach is lexicon based and Marten has outlined the pros and cons of the approach. I would like to see alternative ways of harvesting twitter content to include emoticons to complement the lexicon approach.
5.0,"Wow, this course is fantastic!! I completed it over two days and I can now perform sentiment analysis on tweets in R, explore the data in Tableau and present the results in an interactive dashboard. This course really takes you from 'absolute novice' to 'highly skilled at performing sentiment analysis on tweets'. As a result I feel confident adding 'sentiment analysis' to the skills section of my CV and know that if I am called on to do one, I will be able to do a really professional job of it. And as an added benefit I learnt a lot of new R commands and A LOT of hands-on Tableau stuff. Altogether an incredibly worthwhile course! I can't thank the creator enough!!"
4.5,I knew nothing about R or Tableau and this course really helped me a lot to keep my project easy and simple.
5.0,very good but require little bit slow
5.0,"Overall, the course was really outstanding. Two elements are covered that are so important and difficult to find information:"
4.0,"The sections on R were interesting - the section on Tableau was less interesting, however generally this was very good."
5.0,I have been struggling to find a course in tweeter Analytics until I enrolled for your work and i can't complain. The material is easy to understand and really interactive and applicable at the same time. I had little knowledge in R but the seamless with which the course materials are delivered is just precise. Thanks man
2.0,"There are no links to download code or data for the lexicon. There are several places where there are jumps that are not explained. Overall, I think this is the last time I try one of these courses. I am able to move along thanks to outside websites that cover the same topic and give more detailed information."
5.0,Much helpful course for analyst. I am glad to see this course on udemy. This is very systematic approach for a case study.
5.0,Thank you very much. I could follow the explanations very well and apply the to my own data. The instructor speaks very clearly and presents the content in a sistematic way.
5.0,It was because it introduced me to Tableau and familiarized me with coding.
5.0,"I needed to do analysis on text data I had already harvested - so I didn't need the R part of the lesson, but I learned a lot about extracting insights out of text using Tableau calculations and parameters"
5.0,Very very amazing course
1.0,lots of errors in between we get stuck and there is no one to help the course code is too confusing to follow
5.0,Yes. I'm learning about how these programs work in conjunction.
4.5,I want to learn more and to practice. That's great. Thank you.
4.5,"Instructor is very good in delivery.  The presentations are clear, concise and direct.  There is no halting speech, repetitive comments or irrelevant discussion. "
4.5,"good content, but a few more exercises would be nice."
5.0,"This is really good, I'm learning a lot of new techniques and the instructor is really good at explaining clearly. I have only little R experience and I find the level and path really comfortable."
3.5,Detailsaboutconnectingtotwitterareobsolete.Theyneedtobeupdated.
4.5,This is a great course. Thank you so much for doing this course. :)
5.0,Amazing course with sentiment analysis concept
4.5,Yes this is very helpful even if I am not going to use day to day
5.0,Super strukturiert und nachvollziehbar erklärt
5.0,your tutorial is very clear...thanks a lot.
5.0,Enhancing Tableau with R capabilities is a good idea. 
5.0,"It is surprisingly easy to integrate R into Tableau. There is even a feature in Tableau that lets you do that. At the R side there are some packages that need to be installed first, but these are explained in the course. "
5.0,so far so good. love the new format (business case based)
5.0,Its good and better explained....
5.0,Interesting concept which I did not think about so far. The course videos follow a logical order. The slides do support a lot in understanding the material. Overall well developed.
2.0,the course is outdated! and no effort has been made to change it
5.0,Very helpful and friendly support when there are questions - even for questions outside the course script
3.5,Good course.
5.0,very good way to explain
5.0,So far so good!
4.5,great information
5.0,The course is easy to follow. Interesting approach to sentiment analysis.
5.0,Yes it was good
5.0,I think the use case outlined here is relevant in the real world. Instructor videos contain extra slides to follow the code. Much info packed in a few hours.
5.0,Good quality so far. Course is exactly what I expected. Actionable advice.
4.0,easy to follow and comprehend
5.0,The method shown in the course is quite interesting. I could not find it somewhere else so far. Basically you are combining Tableau and R to get a nice graph and to display the results. Videos are really clear and have a good pace.
5.0,Step by step instructions are easy to follow.
5.0,"The idea presented here does make a lot of sense if you need to present data to a wider audience, especially in business and marketing. That is why I took it and I am positive that I can use the method at work."
5.0,Very good video presentations. And the course structure makes sense. It is a combination approach with R and Tableau.
5.0,"the content is presented in an easy going way, which is great. I could follow along easy although R is not my strength (yet)."
5.0,"Awesome, the Tableau training was very valuable"
5.0,"Speed of delivery was very good, slides in the videos help a lot in understanding the concepts. Course is great for people in marketing."
3.0,needs to have some more basic knowledge before going straight into technical terms.
5.0,Pace and delivery are very good. I would take this course again since I learned what I needed.
1.0,"Awful , you need a develepor account which is way hard to get , these bastards wont tell you that ."
4.5,I enjoyed this course. Useful and Applicable
3.0,provide some bookmarks for this required
1.0,"The description of this course did NOT mention that Twitter made it much more difficult to obtain developer accounts. Despite following all the directions in this course, I was not able to get authorization to collect Twitter data, which is STEP ONE, and without it, this course is useless."
4.0,I am new to analysing twitter in R & this is interesting so far.
5.0,I am pretty convinced that I can use this on a project at work.
5.0,Very easy to follow lecture
5.0,its awesome
4.5,yes
3.5,so far so good.
4.0,.
5.0,NA
5.0,good
5.0,Good
5.0,good course
5.0,Well explained all the concepts ❤️Bam!
5.0,"An amazing experience, Thank You."
5.0,"Amazing course ....... Because of this course, I am capable to supervise multiple MS thesis .... Thank you Dr. Taimur for such a valuable course"
3.5,Many videos were not fully recorded and the volume vary in each video. Examples were good but could be explained further
4.5,Professor TAimoor khan made Text Mining accessible for someone like me with very little programming experience. The step-by-step approach breaks down Text Mining neatly.
5.0,Pro: Course contains many notebooks with detailed explanations of how to implement text mining.
5.0,"An outstanding course that provides a ton of missing details not covered in other courses. Kudos to Sir Taimoor for his teaching style, passion and wealth of information!"
5.0,An absolutely wonderful course! I learned a lot about text mining. I think it is a must-take course for those who are interested in project based learning.
5.0,This course widely covers Text Mining topics and explained very well. The codes are practical and useful. I'll recommend to everyone who is interested in Text Mining.
4.5,Very useful Boot camp for beginners in Text mining. it takes you from scratch
2.0,Can not follow all explanations.
5.0,Don't underestimate the tutor if you aim to become Pioneer in Machine Learning. Both thumbs up !!!
4.5,Amazing
4.0,"It is going very good until now. I found that it is very to the point without creating any confusions. Yeah, It is very much helpful for me. Keep it up"
5.0,Very Helping course and very to the point and precise explanation of every concept
4.5,Simple and informative.
5.0,"Exceptional! Gets right to the point and explains very well. The instructors explained everything clearly and nicely, just what I needed."
5.0,Beautiful Professor !!
5.0,It is so simple to understand for a beginner as well
5.0,Excellent Elaboration
3.5,audio is poor
5.0,"Amazing, above expectations! recommended."
5.0,"Clear, simple and concise"
4.5,Good illustration with good pace.
1.5,Instructor is explaining the concepts at very fast pace and the conceptual and code explanation is not for beginners.
2.0,its my fault that i didnt grasp the statistics behind ML models
5.0,"Really good course. Covers exactly what it promises, which is text mining for beginners! There is no redundant information, such as introduction to python or extensive no sense theoretical talks. Someone who knows python and data modeling, just comes here to learn text mining."
4.0,Good for beginners and but requires some familiarity with Python.
5.0,Superb Course ! The instructor has explained the output in detail and ensured that user can understand why he is doing a particular step.
4.5,"Course is well organized. I got a basic understanding of NLP concepts like tokenization, lemmatization. I understood the context of Naive Bayes for sentiment analysis and for document classification problems. Explanation for solving the classification problem using NLTK and Scikit libraries is clear."
4.5,I loved this course. Explanations are very precise and emphasized well.
4.0,Experience was overall good . Learned a lot and the modules were up to the point . A great learning experience.
4.5,"It was very easy to understand and straight to the point . I was hoping for some more contents on topic modeling but since this is a beginners class, the course fits its description"
3.0,The content was good but the person presenting needs to be learn to talk in a way that doesn't go up and down so much and halt every other word. Its very distracting.
4.0,"It's exactly what it promises. Includes some data and python files, good walkthroughs. Really can't complain. Good for a short, free course on NLP."
4.0,"For free good for nlp absolute basics, I would recommend watching this first and after that moving on different courses, because nlp has a lot of little things you need to remember"
4.0,"The Course was well organized, perfect for people who are just starting with NLP. More, courses from Statinfer Solutions are eagerly awaited on other Machine Learning Topics."
4.0,I have attended couple of other courses in various platforms and I can definitely say that that your way of explaining Bayes theorem is best so far.
4.0,The course till now is very good. It provides step by step process of how to process data. However the video content is bad in each video and that makes learning difficult.
4.5,"a little bit too much repeating the same things over and over, but the content is in general very interesting and presented in simple and structured way. for a total newbie it was easy to follow."
3.0,"I cannot find the supporting codes and slides for the class. If I can get access to these resources, it would be perfect."
4.0,The class was helpful and informative. The math equations were a little unclear for me.
2.5,The coding examples could have been more clear. The tutor can explain the code rather than just executing it.
5.0,"This course has been very helpful, it will take you through all the essentials down to intermediate level, but of course you will have to do the labs to get to advanced levels. I enjoyed this course and i would recommend it to those interested in data analysis, text data is very important also."
4.5,I want to do text mining on dataset. These dataset i have but i can't do text mining for all fields which are present in that dataset so i request you to tell me how to do this. I want to perform TFIDF algorithm on dataset.
4.5,"Very Informative, appriciate"
4.0,Course is highly helpful for beginner as text Analytics and explanation is clear and concise.
4.0,"I am a beginner to intermediate python user, and i find this course useful. However i am struggling with coding. EIther you are skipping some steps or maybe you are too focused to teach what the title of the course says. Overal its a very good course, just that i rate it as per my experience."
5.0,This was a good intro into NLP with python. I loved the projects (real life examples).
4.0,great course!
5.0,nice one......  go for it if you wish to learn basics of NLP
2.5,I can not follow some of the talks. the instructor has a strong accent.
4.5,Very good course to begin with for  NLP and sentiment analysis

Overall great experience with this course."
1.0,"way too fast. Rattle isn't working properly, no answer is given as to why this is the case..."
5.0,its a wonderful course and full of info. i recommend it to everyone. Great Experience
3.5,So far so good.  The aspect I struggle with is being able to keep up with the instructor and tracking all of her button click locations.
5.0,good stuff thks 4 it !!!
2.5,Not at all for the beginner. I'm so thankful to have a husband in Data Science to help me figure out how to get my R and R Studio to the same place as the instructor. The introduction makes many assumptions about what you already have downloaded! I'm soldiering on because I can see the potential uses of these skills. A future modification to this class that would have helped would be to go through how to load packages and then to give a list of the packages and data sets that need to be loaded (ex: diamonds did NOT come preloaded with Rattle)
2.5,Graph reading Explanation is very less.
5.0,Al together a unique course and perfect guidance of Instructor. 5 star rating to her. Really nice
5.0,Predictive mean mapping method is just awesome
5.0,"I found this course very straightforward to follow. This R Programming Course for Data Science enthusiasts is absolutely great!

Some of the tough concepts were explained in a constructive and practical manner. I will highly recommend the course to beginners!"
4.0,Good lesson for a new of R.
5.0,"Amazing Instructor, Loved the way of Analyzing and explaining the each piece of code. I'm looking forward for his another Course. Thanks Minerva"
5.0,"Nice introductory course, helped me to understand the basics of R and be able to move on to more complex R tasks and packages. The Instructor does an awesome job of ""making the complex simple""."
5.0,Before starting with this course I actually didn't know anything about Data Science and this course helped me to explore some R functions. I think that it was a good experience.
5.0,"Amazing! I am very new to Data Analytics. I was doing bigger course and part of it had R Programming. But, I felt that was limited. So, I came to Udemy to look for R Programming. Now, having done this course, it laid a strong foundation for that. I am grateful to Minerva."
5.0,"For a beginner like me, it was easy to learn and understand R programming through this tutorial.

5.0,The most i liked is that Minerva gives main ideas perfectly. this course is perfect for beginers. Thank you so much
5.0,"Fantastic Course.. Before starting this course, I had zero knowledge of R programming.. Minerva Singh is an excellent tutor. The course starts from the very basic and builds up concepts slowly and steadily. The challenge exercises are really thought provoking. I'm excited to attend the advance course now. This course is lot better than learning through a book."
5.0,"I really enjoyed this course. This was my first go at coding. The instructor was easy to understand and gave lots of tips and tricks. Although it moved pretty quickly, I liked that I could pause, rewind, and learn at my own pace. Thank you. I now feel empowered and ready to move on to more learning data science and data mining R."
4.0,Very good and useful for me
5.0,Informative course
5.0,minerva is a really good instructor. He explains everything very nicely making it easier for students to understand the topic.

5.0,Your Creativity is always Exclusive. Love It
5.0,I was completely new to R and this was very easy to follow. The exercises were fun and Minerva was very engaging.
5.0,Knowledgeable
5.0,it was my comfortable course. All the data science courses that I have seen so far were not like my mind
5.0,"I really like the way the course was layout in a very friendly speaking pace, with a lot of back up resources."
5.0,Aan het begin van de cursus voelde ik me net zo veel als het was

5.0,Comme le cours
5.0,Amazing course
5.0,Great course and instructor
1.0,not much about nlp
3.0,"Course could be more direct. Some users might not understand the point or principles of variables. The introduction could be on the required programs and purpose of it. To some it up, keep it short and sweet."
5.0,clear an concise. It may be improved by explaining how it can be used in the real world !!!!
3.5,GOOD
2.5,Meanwhile outdated.
5.0,This course is very informative and well explained. Excellent video.
3.0,The sound quality could be better. 
4.5,"Often difficult to be seeing what the instructor has in the screen and what he is talking (it is difficult for the eyes to see the flipping in the screen); instructor often corrects what he say, and this makes it difficult to grasp the key content (has to rewind often)."
5.0,"Amazing course Geoff, like always!"
2.5,The course is elementary in nature and has good examples. It will be helpful to those who are new to R
1.0,"I'm disappointed that lecturer is not able to explain some things and is referring to ""I've tried but could not understand"". I don't think this is worth mentioning if you really tried and have not understood."
4.5,All is good but i'd like that we can see more complex models
3.0,Instructor should be more prepared for the course.
4.0,"Content is Good,but going at a slower pace."
2.5,Quite boring also the instructor is not confident enough hence not able to make us understand the logic behind every code.
2.5,"Seems that the lecturer could have prepared a little bit better for making the videos, not to get puzzled and lost in its own code."
4.0,"It is little hard to follow the lecture with so much code on the screen.  Sometimes, I can't tell what he is pointing to as the cursor is hard to see. It really isn't necessary to try and cover every tidbit in the R index.  Pick the most useful data science tools based on your experience and delve into those.  We can add other details as we explore through our own experiences."
1.0,"There was a mistake in the association Rules formula for Support. It has to be intersection and not union. I am disappointed that despite double checking , the author is providing this key definition wrong. One has to get conceptual and Mathematical understanding right before delving into the coding."
3.0,code doesn't work in alot of these tutorials
2.0,the course is not understandable for hearing and the structure is not by any metodology
3.0,"The instructor's guidance to ""learn by using"" isn't reflected in the first few minutes. The asides during instruction are also a bit distracting; however, I look forward to the rest of the instruction."
3.5,"The content is not bad, but could be explained in a more concise manner. The lecturer sometimes is not confident; he forgets some details and immediately admits that :)"
2.5,A lot of dummy words and a lot of questions dont answered
4.0,so far so good
5.0,Great course! I'm learning a lot in how to Data Mine with R.
4.5,Thanks.
4.5,"It was helpful in many ways however there were a few moments when I got stuck while watching the videos as there are a few out of date things to deal with. Overall amazing course, good speaker to guide too."
1.0,the instructor will not respond to your questions if you have any. The last response related to two years ago.
4.0,Awesome course and very well explained! Kudos!
5.0,"yes , excellent teaching"
5.0,"Honestly telling I would have taken this course at very early, concepts are explained briefly and concisely . if someone want to taste the flavor of NLP this one will be my first suggestion. Thanks to Bijoyan. If he features new course (mainly project based) on NLP with deep-learning it will be a no brainer in Udemy platform. Thanks once again."
2.0,"The instructor doesn't really explain what he's planning to do in a particular lecture or section. He just starts off writing some code without explaining the objective, naming conventions and the concept expecting us to follow. This is not a good strategy to teach students effectively."
5.0,great
4.5,audio/sound level is too low. cannot hear very clearly
4.0,This course is helpful. But the instructor rarely responds to the questions.
5.0,the course got into the coding of many of the real world applications. it gave a great insight.
4.0,"The course is good, the student should be paying attention because the lecturer made some mistakes. But it is a good introduction to text mining"
3.5,It is good course to start with but I still believe there is scope of improvement. Having said that somebody who has just started exploring NLP with Python will find the course useful.
4.5,I am very inspired by the fact that the instructor is a young man sharing his knowledge through this course. I am sure the future holds great things for him. The explanations and the flow and the examples are all well presented. Only not sure if the coding (layers of nested for loops and if conditions etc.) is efficient and the best practice in the real world. Overall it is great course for someone looking to be introduced to NLP with some limited background in python & ML .
4.5,"Very good course for beginners, particularly the projects at the latter half of the course."
4.5,"I think it is one of the best course to learn NLP. This course carries you from the beginner level to the advance level. Thanks to the instructor for preparing this course. Hope to have DeepNLP course also, v soon. Thanks"
4.5,"This is one of the best course, i see. Though there are some issue, like font size, code should be in center of editor."
5.0,This course is perfect to learn NLP for beginners. It covers the background knowledge regarding the various libraries used for deeper understanding of the the topics. It has helped me in successfully implementing my summer internship project using NLP models.
5.0,This course is really good for beginners.Instructor is also experienced and he provided the best solution of my queries.
4.5,"J'ai trouvé le cours très intéressant car il explique comment sont calculées les représentations des moet dans les textes pour faire des analyses et les projet sont très intéressants car ils expliques commet utiliser les réprésentations  (BOW, TF-IDF, n-gram) basées sur le  comptage d'occurences des mots pour des problèmes concrets de NLP certes de petites tailles. Aussi dans le cours,  des librairies sont utlisées pour aller plus vite dans certains calculs."
1.0,"This course is really bad. The instructor shows very poor understanding of the theoretical background, often gets things wrong (e.g. what the files and columns of a confusion matrix represent), and in many lectures does very little apart from typing the commands without explaining them. Poor value for money."
5.0,"It is fun to have hands-on experience on NLP, which is currently in trend. The explanation is concise, and I especially like the knowledge about scraping online news."
4.5,The course is very good for me who has limited experience with NLP. It gave me an overview of what NLP is and a hands-on experience of building some small applications. the pace of the course is just right. I definitely have learned a lot from this course that fully met or even exceeded my expectation
4.0,"The course was impressive and highly informative, covered a lot of information on NLP, would have been nice to have some deep learning enclosed in the package."
4.5,Overall course was good.You will get all the basics of NLP and its  implementation using python by doing this course.
4.0,This course is structured in an organized manner with projects and easy to learn. Good for beginners to learn NLP with Python !!!
1.5,"For a very shallow intro this isn't bad. I really expected to get more out of this course. When you compare this to other NLP/data science courses, you simply don't get the level of detail and expertise as some of the other courses. He will move over things that are very relevant to understanding the process, so if you just want to copy code and do what he does, this is right for you. If you want to understand what's ""under the hood"" this will leave a lot out. In a lot of courses you have to do a lot of research externally, but I really don't think this course gives your enough to be worth while. I really got tired of him saying things like ""We will not cover that on this course"" about 50% of the way through. he will occasionally direct you of where to get the additional information, but I would try another  course if I knew this from the beginning."
5.0,Absolutely clarifying and educating. A perfect place to code the basics in python and get all the usefull training and info to start in NLP!
4.5,Clear explanation in a good pace. Got me started with a project I‘ve been dredging for a long time
3.5,"I found some nltk modules to be useful. I mainly enrolled in the course to find ways to extract key concepts from scientific literature, so while NLP is useful for general population text analysis, the applications may be limited for me."
5.0,Bijoyan Das is very good teacher. He explains concepts slowly and clearly. This is a complex topic . But the instructor has done an awesome job of unravelling the mystery behind text mining. I wish him the very best in his computer science career ahead.
5.0,"By far the best NLP course on Udemy. I highly recommend starting here if you're interested in NLP. The instructor's python coding is also very intuitive and he does a great job explaining along the way. This was good for me. I'm a SAS programmer, and python doesn't immediately click with me."
5.0,This course was the one i was looking for. I had already taken 3 courses in NLP but they were not worth it. Its a complete package for NLP in text.
4.0,I liked all the chapters/videos except word2vec. It could have been much more detailed.
5.0,The python overview is very good. I was not expecting to learn much but I picked up on many tricks. I also thought the NLP was very comprehensive and easy to understand. I will say I think this course might be difficult to undertstand for someone who has never coded in python before.
5.0,This course is well explained by the tutor. I really like the content and it is for beginners in NLP. Big thank you for sharing this.
5.0,Just started learning NLP and prior knowledge how python works and  i think i have taken a right step by taking this course
4.0,"It is a good match as it is direct to the point, teaching the required hand-on skills that are useful in everyday work. The theory can be learned later as additional branches of the tree."
5.0,The course 'Hands On Natural Language Processing (NLP) using Python' was excellent. The way in which the instructor delivers the content is engaging. This course is a must for someone who wishes to learn NLP with python and wants to focus on TEXT ANALYSIS. This course also teaches how to implement Machine Learning in context of NLP on Text Analysis. The instructor is very responsive and always answered all of my doubts and queries within few hours of  posting the same. Overall its a must do course !!!. A big thanks to the instructor and Udemy for bringing out this course.
3.5,Course is great for beginners. Learned a lot. But trainer doesnt respond to the questions
2.5,"There is litle information regarding the subject (NPL) on this course compared with other stuff. The instructor spent a lot of time on showing Python basics, Twitter API, Web crawler, etc that doesn't seems relevant on my opinion."
2.0,"Not for beginners in python. Also, you ask question but you get answer (now 3 days and I saw others questions not answered more than a week). Sometimes, he writes long code (loop inside loop inside loop) so easy to get lost."
3.0,"I am learning new things, thanks for making the videos.  "
5.0,this is a very good course to get started with NLP. The instructor explains every single line of code that he writes. Theory and practical examples are very well combined. A plus is the pleasant and friendly voice of the instructor. I totally recommend it.

5.0,"one of the best courses in nlp ,instructor explained very throughly every concept, thank u very much"
3.5,"This course is quite thorough in covering all the basics of NLP.  The projects are a great starting point and really help. I would have liked a final project that we had to complete ourselves, but other than that I am satisfied with the course content and the instructor. One note to the instructor is maybe use Juputer Notebook as it was hard to see against the dark theme of Spyder. It is also more of an industry standard. I followed along using Jupyter Notebook which simplified everything."

1.0,Practical NLP projects are the most common and the basic level which is available in every NLP tutorial of different instructors. The practical code was not explained properly.While explaining python code he is leaving many python instruction or code in between. Sometimes you have not even run final print command to show the learner how and what the output is coming.No new project and case study involves that helps the learner to get a better understanding.

5.0,"Of the classes I have taken on Udemy, this is my favorite. Ivo is clear and thorough. He works through examples in an exhaustive step-by-step manner, assuming you know nothing about this topic. That means that when I really know nothing about a topic, I am able to learn everything (including the reason for doing things a certain way). In cases where I already possess some knowledge about the topic, I find it easy to speed through that section. In fact, I can check my knowledge ahead of time using his handy quizzes. If I ace the quiz before I start the section, I know I don't need to spend a lot of time on that section. His quizzes are an excellent way to test my knowledge after I finish a section, to ensure I learned the right lessons. I've even been keeping notes about the course and his teaching style in case I'm in a position to teach this content to someone else in the future."
3.5,"Good course. I like how it is structureted. But I have to admit that sometimes variables naming was confusing. For example, in some videos there's ""context_word"" and ""word_contex"" as two different variables in the same function."

5.0,Very good course on R.  I knew quite a bit but learned a lot.  learned some new ways to do things that I had not thought of.
5.0,"This is by far the best course I ever took anywhere.  After going through Regression course, I signed up for all the courses taught by the professor. I am amazed at the way he simplifies the concepts and makes us understand the theories with real life examples.  He has an excellent teacher.  I will recommend his courses  to anyone who wants to learn and have a strong foundation of Data Science concepts."

4.0,I feel sometimes same things are repeated again without any significance
5.0,"very clear and comprehensive explanations.  If there were six stars, I would give this instructor all of it because he said, if you don't listen to your wife in getting six eggs, she will beat you..ha ha ha ha.  I can totally relate to him.

5.0,Enjoying this course....I like way the trainer teaches... Looking forward to learn more on Data Science
4.5,"I am Still in the statistics part, haven't started coding yet. "
3.0,I was interested in doing forecasting with R.  I already know all the statistical theory.  The programming plan is not well explained.
5.0,"The course content is good and the instructor is explaining and proving every point and his argument with an example. Also, the instructor is explaining things by using some random examples."
4.0,"I am a statistician and this course is very refreshing for me and it gives me another perspective, that is the business perspective of applied statistics."
5.0,good detailed explanation
3.0,the instructor give an overview of everything without go within the details

5.0,"I find these course extremely useful for me, as I have chosen this topic on my own interest. Looking forward to learn more about the data science.."
5.0,I started off this course from the Linear Regression part and i can say that among the many udemy courses available this one covered the topic in a most comprehensive manner. The author in addition to talking about all the relevant R-codes also went quite in depth into the statistical aspect of the same which i was not able to find in any other udemy course as most of them usually talked about the R-part and gave a brief summary of the necessary statistics or completely skipped it.
5.0,Comprehensive and well explained!
4.0,speed of speaking is less. I have to run video at 1.5x. Content wise good. Covers from basics.
3.5,Theoretically good content. Could have been better if some concepts explained with intuition.
5.0,The guy gets 5 stars solely for explaining degrees of freedom in a way I actually comprehend. He is so straight-forward. I love it.
5.0,Really like the way Bharani teaches this course.  It's down-to-earth and not overly polished or produced - I appreciate that.  His attention to detail is really helping me learn this subject and will indeed help me in furthering my career.
1.5,"Till now the teacher appears to be good news reader and nothing more than that. He is building concepts from the basics which is actually way too basic. Anyways, what is irritating is a sound at the background that plays after every 10 secs and it is really disturbing. Hopefully, the course content will improve in the future session. At this poin i am done with 16 lectures, I believe"
4.0,good content
5.0,Excellent
5.0,The way of explaintion is way superior and examples are super handy to understand complex concepts
4.5,as of now its good experience waiting for the next round of class
5.0,He makes these lessons easy to understand.
5.0,Good course.....and good for beginners...It would be very helpful if you upload advance concepts..
5.0,The instructor is teaching in a very lucid way with a lot of examples and covering a huge area. Its really awesome.
2.0,It's too basic knowledge about statistic. The title should be changed because this is mostly introduction to statistics and some R coding. Maybe I know too much to take this course but the title doesn't show how the course has basic knowledge . I hope I will learn something as I proceed the course..
1.0,"I am an English mother tongue but I had a huge difficulty on understanding most of the spoken parts. To worsen the course the teacher is constantly loading up pages on internet, jumping chaotically from one program to another and an annoying sound continuously appears. The course It is really confusing and poor. I did pay really little compared to the original price but I have to admit that every course in Udemy has got courses that cost one tenth of the original price."
5.0,"The explanation is so good, that at one go you would understand the concept. Very clearly explained. The trainer's experience is all shown the way he had dealt with the subject makes learning so easy. Happy to have purchased this course. This is so helpful in learning the subject."
3.0,MUY DETALLADADO Y EXPLICADO CON MUCHA CLARIDAD
5.0,Very nicely explained...But content is pure basic
5.0,Good details and concepts are covered... Nice explanations.
5.0,It is contain knowledge about different things and shows you as well.
5.0,nice explanation ... Expecting more advanced concepts..
2.5,"the zip file introduction section did not open and it is called ""Data-Science-Material-and-R-codes"" . I put this issue in Q&A section and no reply so far and I don't see replies to other people so I don't know if instructor usually  connect with students or not"
5.0,"Very good quality, however a bit outdated for 2019. For example, it is 2019, in a month it will be 2020, and we get to have 5G. Also, with machine learning, data scientist may not be in such high demand."
5.0,its really superb...
3.0,The audio is somewhat fuzzy. Could use better microphone for more clear audio
5.0,Each Topic are explained with an example and the pace is also slow
5.0,Best online R course I've seen so far!
5.0,This course has the perfect balance of theory which leaves you with a solid understanding of the concepts. I LOVE that he responded to my question within a day. Well done!
5.0,"Amazing delivered course,  instructor has command over the subject he is teaching and teaches very passionately; fortunate to have this kind of trainers;"
2.0,annoying beep in background. Classes read like script versus natural spoken language.  Zip files with sample code did not work for statistical exercises or text mining which is what I wanted the course for - just kept opening new zips.  Annoying use of the Pen tool on the lesson to draw numbers and symbols - very distracting and hard to read.  Really disappointed in this course.  there are better R courses out there.
2.5,"Very basic for beginners, I have selected the wrong course for me"
5.0,Till now the content is very good. Topics covered so far are very clearly explained.

4.5,It was a very good course to understand text mining with R.
1.0,1. More than 60% of the course isn’t about NLP. 
3.5,"The course in general is good but both materials and the overall structure are a little bit messed up. They seem not to have a logical order . This course is absolutely not affordable by newbies and I think it's difficult even for someone who already has a base of text mining, ML and NLP. The theory is poor and the course hasn't been updated since 2018. A couple of years in data science is a certain time. Some functions  have been changed or  are deprecated, while others closed up. And API for social mining too... It's a pity. Let's hope that teacher would update the course."

5.0,"That's called quality course. Everything is just like a student needed! Well explained lecture, exclusive codes, ton of resources makes this course perfect. I am not only satisfies but also will recommend it to everyone."
1.0,"Lots of code chunks are copied from other tutorials which are freely accessible in the internet. The author does not properly mention the original source, which is very bad scientific practice! Furthermore, the author does not really ""explain"" WHY the code is like it is, nor does she explain the theoretical background; the videos are mostly just a plain reading of code chunks you can listen to. Therefore a bad rating."

Similarly, I like the way the Instructor uses TidyText/TidyVerse and Quanteda  - so, it really shows that the course is really up to date!! Thanks"
5.0,"An amazing course for Text Mining. I am actually building a web app in this area. Thanks a lot for the ingredients provided. I recommend this to everyone who is interested in NLP and Sentiment Analysis. #Minerva, maybe you can also do a course on Shiny for R."
5.0,The most hands-on course on R based text mining
4.0,"Plenty of codes and materials that can be reused. Would have given 5 stars if she was still updating the course but unfortunately that is no longer the case so some of the codes might not work and she is not replying anymore, some of the questions are a year old with no answer."
4.0,Good course to understand concepts of NLP. Intution for each concepts can be explained better before the coding part of each section.

2.5,"Too focussed on just the code; not able to establish the context or the use case. In some tutorials it feels like the code has been lifted from somewhere else, hence the presenter is not able to explain the real utility of the same."
5.0,"The course is well structured, the final section about using machine learning with text data is particularly very useful."
5.0,Easy to follow and a pleasure to listen to

5.0,The course is like long journey and really comprehensive. I am extremely happy and satisfied to have this course in my learning basket. Thanks a lot!
1.0,The instructor can not teach the materials clearly. She talks in a way that she is reviewing the materials with herself not teaching it. It is hard to follow. I recommend to work on teaching skills first and then create a course.
5.0,A maze with a nugget of cheese at every corner.....
3.0,"Goes through the basics nicely, however may topics are outdated or simply do not work anymore. Overall quite exhaustive in the field of data scraping using R, learned many new packages and tricks to use."

4.5,"EL curso es bueno, sin embargo, recomendaría realizar este curso en varias partes (II,III, IV, etc), sobre todo en que pudieran existir mas ejercicios para práctica. Por otro lado, ninguno de los recursos habilitados .zip me abrieron ."
5.0,Very Nice course...Well Explained....Please upload nlp using R..It would be very help for us....
5.0,Very Informative with R codes and good Explanation.... With R codes i will give 5 star rating..

3.0,"Very superficial so far, no clear examples with codes."
3.0,Unnecessarily Verbose!
1.0,"It's very disappointing to say that the instructor has copy pasted from some of his lectures and created this course which are not in sync. The course starts with introductory concepts on text mining but doesn't translates well into the practical use of the concepts in R as is mentioned in the course title. The instructor explains in the course - what is a package and how it is installed or loaded, how to include comments using ""#"" in R-code but didn't take the effort to explain the code structure. He simple runs the code and says it is available for download with the course. To put it in simple words, my objective of joining this course wasn't to get a code file, instead I have come here to learn how I can write my own code and perform analysis which was not at all discussed in the course (except for extracting tweets and reviews from Amazon)."
4.5,The instructor explained the subject matter well.  I was looking for more R code and exercises to strengthen my R skills.
5.0,Explained very well..... Interesting course..
3.5,"The presentation could be improved further; I have taken a couple of courses with Kirill Eremenko, and I like his style of presentation, so maybe I am being biase, but I still think there's more room for improvement. Thank you."
3.0,very basic level info and not worth the price.

4.5,"I'm doing my graduation and was finding it difficult to do my project related to sentiment analysis. With this course, which came in handy, I understood all the concepts clearly and applied them in my final year project. Thank you so much for such unique and easy explained lessons and lectures."
5.0,"Benjamin, I must say this is one of the best online courses I have taken. You have broken down the training into easy to follow with explanations that many other instructors may not be as thorough as you did. I truly enjoy this course very much."
4.0,"It's useful for how to create basic sentiment analaysis things, but it can improve adding more exercises and more detail information. I expect next course :)"
1.0,The course barely had anything useful for me as a beginner in sentiment analysis. I expected a breakdown of sentiment analysis plus a project i could use as a blue print when working on other sentiment analysis projects. Waste of my money
4.5,"A good but fairly superficial use of a wide variety of concepts in NLP - can't say that I actually understand them. Also, I expected to apply by actually connecting to the Twitter API."
2.5,He explains superficially how to do things like lemmatize...
5.0,"the step by step is easy to follow, and it'd e great if can have a transcript."
3.0,"The course works with already labeled data (negative, positive). We do not learn how to label data and without that knowledge you cannot do proper sentiment analysis."
5.0,Feel really good and helpful!
3.5,"Straight forward and to the point material. The right balance of theory vs coding. Got me started with the basics of word tokenization and sentiment analysis, which is why I wanted this course in the first place. Good for Beginners."
4.5,"So far not sure, but the presenter is convincing"
5.0,It was a good match and he articulated very well when explaining text and text mining.
5.0,"Very good, short course which covers all important topics in just 2.5 h!"
4.0,Good introduction on the background of text analytics and its applications
5.0,"As a social scientist, I was interested in using python for discourse analysis – the course is clearly structured and focuses on providing a hands-on insight into NLP with lots of great insights, tricks and visualizations …"
3.5,Time has not come yet to comment.
5.0,introduction can be shorter
4.0,Still introduction
3.0,Technically it is definitely good match and content is satisfying but i can barely understand the representer because of his accent.

4.5,The course was very hands-on and the teacher is very knowledgeable and helpful. My understanding of NLP and SA grew significantly thanks to the course.
5.0,"The course was  very good and gave me way much more clarity about how sentiment analysis works. Had a few unclear things at first in my first review but I really appreciated the instructur taking the time to reply and offering to answer my question and to be honest I find this pretty amazing (upgrading to 5 starts :d).  All theoretical concepts were very well explained. Thank you so much, this really helped me with my dissertation"
5.0,"I was really impressed by the way the course is organised. There are code challenges, it doesn't get too in depth with theory. It's enough to make you understand the general idea and feel like the code it's valuable. Thank you for the great work! I'll follow you for more."
4.5,"An excellent course and a great task-oriented introduction to NLP. Rather than just walking through a single example in a ""do this then do that"", the instructor provided explanations that were simple but not simplistic. I would have given it five stars except that the CountVector model did not converge."
5.0,"Just the nice amount of explanation, and excellent practical for quick dive in text mining"
5.0,This course will surely help us to do a project like this.

5.0,Super experience. Everything is covered in the course to completely understand text mining and how it can be applied to sentiment analysis. 
5.0,Very happy I took this course. Will update my review at the end of the course.
